Portfolio-Page

This is a portfolio page to display my projects on and outside of Github in an easy to digest format, including useful contact and biographical information about me.
Overiew

This portfolio site consists of three basic pages, a landing, projects page, and about me section. The Landing is a visual showcase that displays my name and job title proudly. My projects page is where I plan on keeping finished builds of my personal projects to showcase to those interested in seeing my work. The about me section features some highlights of my experience, education, tech stack, and what drives me to create.
